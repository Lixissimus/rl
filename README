If you want to try the Contact planner:

Hit space to start planning and F12 to reset the planner.


Troubleshooting:
Q: I cannot build the robotics library under Ubuntu 16.04
A: The launchpad repository is broken for 16.04. Markus Rickert (roboticslibrary developer) told me there will be a new version very soon that works under 16.04.

Q: The planner says "start or goal invalid" for the plan file above
A: You need an english number format in your OS. On Ubuntu type "locale" in the shell - there should be something like LC_NUMERIC=en_US.UTF-8. If it says something with "DE" you have to change the LC_NUMERIC field in /etc/default/locale
